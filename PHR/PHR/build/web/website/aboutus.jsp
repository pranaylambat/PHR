                    <br>
                    A personal health record, or Ehealth system, is a health record where health 
                    data and information related to the care of a patient is maintained
                    by the patient. This stands in contrast to the more widely used 
                    electronic medical record, which is operated by institutions 
                    (such as hospitals) and contains data entered by clinicians or
                    billing data to support insurance claims. The intention of a Ehealth system
                    is to provide a complete and accurate summary of an individual's 
                    medical history which is accessible online. The health data on a Ehealth system
                    might include patient-reported outcome data, lab results, data from
                    devices such as wireless electronic weighing scales or collected
                    passively from a smartphone.

                    <br>
                    Cloud Computing technology offers new
opportunities for outsourcing data, and outsourcing computation
to individuals, start-up businesses, and corporations in health
care. Although cloud computing paradigm provides interesting,
and cost effective opportunities to the users, it is not mature, and
using the cloud introduces new obstacles to users. For instance,
vendor lock-in issue that causes a healthcare system rely on a cloud
vendor infrastructure, and it does not allow the system to easily
transit from one vendor to another. Cloud data privacy is another
issue and data privacy could be violated due to outsourcing data
to a cloud computing system, in particular for a healthcare system
that archives and processes sensitive data. In this paper, we

present a novel cloud computing platform based on a Service-
Oriented cloud architecture.

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>
                    <br>
                    Ehealth systems grant patients access to a wide range of health information sources,
                    best medical practices and health knowledge. All of an individual?s 
                    medical records are stored in one place instead of paper-based files
                    in various doctors? offices. Upon encountering a medical condition, 
                    a patient?s health information is only a few clicks away.
                    Moreover, Ehealth systems can benefit clinicians. 
                    Ehealth systems offer patients the opportunity to submit their data to their clinicians' 
                    EHRs. This helps clinicians make better treatment decisions by providing more 
                    continuous data.
                    Ehealth systems have the potential to help analyze an individual?s 
                    health profile and identify health threats and improvement
                    opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical 
                    practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical 
                    errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare 
                    providers and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation
                    of health status. Ehealth systems also make it easier for clinicians to care for their
                    patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic.
                    Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between 
                    patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by 
                    face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication
                    can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions,
                    to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report
                    problems. Additionally, in the case of an emergency a Ehealth system can quickly 
                    provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.
